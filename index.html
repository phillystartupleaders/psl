    <h1>About Philly Startup Leaders</h1>
    <p>PSL began in September of 2007 as a handful of entrepreneurs meeting in the back of a neighborhood bar to trade war stories. After an incredible evening of sharing experiences and giving advice to our peers, we decided to meet again a few weeks later. </p>
    <p>Word soon spread that we had assembled a great group of ambitious young minds, and our ranks began to swell. Within a couple of months, our meetings outgrew the back room of the bar, and we knew that something special was happening. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about-psl">Read more about PSL</a></p>
